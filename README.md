We are trying to create a network of air-pollution sensors in Greece that also sends data to sensor.community.
We have built the sensors, and now it’s time to create a visual-representation project. This way, you can have the sensor, for example, on your balcony, but still see exactly what is happening inside your living room.

We used a Wemos D1 Mini and a WS2812B LED Ring (7 LEDs)

feel free to use..
